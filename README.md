# Java HashMap Search Engine

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the usage of a HashMap to create a sample search engine. In this example, we have three categories: Android, Java, and iOS, each containing a list of related strings. You can use this code as a starting point for building a more advanced search engine or for learning about HashMaps and data organization in Java.
